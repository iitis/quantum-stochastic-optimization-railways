# quantum-stochastic-optimization-railways
application of quantum computation for stochastic optimization on example of railway/tramway network in Baltimore 

Files:

1. QTrains - source code
2. tests - testing source code
3. solutions - stored solutions of railway problems
4. QUBOs - qubos of railway problems
5. histograms - histograms from data analysis

Histograms concerns passing times between selected stations in comparison with ILP results.

The main script for computing on ILP and QUBP far various scenarios in ```solve_qubo.py```

Solutions of (branch) problem with decision tree in ```show_LP_tree.py```

Script ```qubo4gates.py``` saves qubo and ground state as well as analyses output dedicted to gates computiond
